# BusStop
A mobile app that provides you live times for your favorite bus stops near you. Utilizes the [GRT Unofficial Live API](https://github.com/nwoodthorpe/GRTUnofficialLiveAPI) for live times. 

Public transit can be frustrating. Sometimes the buses are early, sometimes they are late, and checking live times can be a hassle. With BusStop, live GRT ETAs are now a click away.

BusStop uses real time data based on current bus GPS information. This means times are always accurate and account for traffic and other unexpected delays.
